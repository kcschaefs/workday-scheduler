# Work Day Scheduler


## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Tasks
- Gary recommends that we use moment.js instead of day.js
- compare timeslots to current time, change class accordingly (past, present, future)
- save user input by timeslot to local storage
- grab user input by timeslot from local storage
- ensure data persists correctly
- set the current day at top of page
- test the code to make sure it works under multiple circumstances

## Learnings
- became much more comfortable with local storage
- gaining familiarity with jQuery, but still pretty uncomfortable with it, I will need to do a lot more practice to feel comfortable with the syntax and possibilities
- learned how to use moment.js and how much easier everything with dates and times becomes with it
- getting more comfortable with conceptualizing the steps and how they will work together, but still need to keep working on this

## Future Improvements
- Add an x button option for deleting the inputs from timeslots
- allow for multiple items to be saved/deleted in a single timeslot
- allow for multiple days
